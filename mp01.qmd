```

## Exploratory Questions

Q1. How many different countries does Netflix operate in? (You can use the viewing history as a proxy for countries in which Netflix operates)

```{r question-1, include=FALSE}
# COUNT DISTINCT COUNTRIES
q1 <- n_distinct(COUNTRY_TOP_10$country_name)

# MAP COUNTRIES WHERE NETFLIX OPERATES
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")

netflix_countries <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
    distinct(country_iso2) |>
    mutate(has_netflix = "Yes")

world_netflix <- world |>
    left_join(netflix_countries, by = c("iso_a2" = "country_iso2")) |>
    mutate(has_netflix = ifelse(is.na(has_netflix), "No", has_netflix))

world_netflix_plot <- ggplot(world_netflix) +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = has_netflix), color = "white", size = 0.2) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("No" = "grey80", "Yes" = "red")) +
    labs(
        title = "Countries Where Netflix Operates",
        fill = "Netflix Available"
    ) +
    theme_minimal()

```

Netflix operates in **`r q1`** different countries based on the viewing history data.
```{r world-netflix-plot, echo=FALSE}
world_netflix_plot
```

```{r ref.label='question-1', eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
```

Q2. Which non-English-language film has spent the most cumulative weeks in the global top 10? How many weeks did it spend?

```{r question-2, include=FALSE}
# FIND NON-ENGLISH FILM WITH MOST CUMULATIVE WEEKS IN GLOBAL TOP 10
q2a <- 
GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
filter(category == "Films (Non-English)" ) |>
group_by(show_title) |> 
summarise(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10 = n()) |> 
arrange(desc(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10)) |> 
slice(1) |> 
pull(show_title)

q2b <- 
GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
filter(category == "Films (Non-English)" ) |> 
group_by(show_title) |> 
summarise(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10 = n()) |>
arrange(desc(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10)) |> 
slice(1) |> 
pull(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10)
```

The non-English-language film that has spent the most cumulative weeks in the global top 10 is ***`r q2a`***   with a total of **`r q2b`** cumulative weeks.

```{r ref.label='question-2', eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

```

Q3. What is the longest film (English or non-English) to have ever appeared in the Netflix global Top 10? How long is it in minutes?

```{r question-3, include=FALSE}
# FIND LONGEST FILM IN GLOBAL TOP 10
q3a <- 
GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
filter(category %in% c("Films (English)", "Films (Non-English)")) |> 
arrange(desc(runtime)) |> 
slice(1) |>
pull(show_title)

q3b <- 
round(60 * GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
filter(category %in% c("Films (English)", "Films (Non-English)")) |>
arrange(desc(runtime)) |>
slice(1) |>
pull(runtime))
```

The longest film to have ever appeared in the Netflix global Top 10 is ***`r q3a`*** with a runtime of **`r q3b`** minutes.

```{r ref.label='question-3', eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
```

Q4. For each of the four categories, what program has the most total hours of global viewership?

```{r question-4, include=FALSE}
# FIND PROGRAM WITH MOST TOTAL HOURS OF GLOBAL VIEWERSHIP IN EACH CATEGORY
q4a <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
group_by(category, show_title) |> 
summarise(total_hours_viewed = sum(weekly_hours_viewed)) |>
arrange(category, desc(total_hours_viewed)) |>
slice_max(total_hours_viewed)

q4 <- datatable(
  q4a,
  colnames = str_replace_all(colnames(q4a), "_", " ") |> str_to_title(),
  rownames = FALSE,
  options = list(
    pageLength = 4,
    searching= FALSE,       
    scrollX = TRUE          
  )
  , caption = "Programs with the most viewership in each category"
) |>
  formatRound(c('total_hours_viewed'), 0) |>
  formatStyle(
    'show_title',
    fontStyle = "italic"
  )
```

The programs with the most total hours of global viewership in each category are: ***`r q4`***

```{r ref.label='question-4', eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

```

Q5. Which TV show had the longest run in a countryâ€™s Top 10? How long was this run and in what country did it occur?

```{r question-5, include=FALSE}
# FIND TV SHOW WITH LONGEST RUN IN A COUNTRY'S TOP 10
q5a <-
COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
filter(category == "TV") |>
arrange(desc(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10)) |>
slice(1) |> 
pull(show_title)

q5b <-
COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
filter(category == "TV") |> 
arrange(desc(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10)) |>
slice(1) |>
pull(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10)

q5c <-
COUNTRY_TOP_10 |> 
filter(category == "TV") |>
arrange(desc(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10)) |>
slice(1) |>
pull(country_name)
```

The TV show with the longest run in a country's Top 10 is ***`r q5a`*** with a run of **`r q5b`** weeks in **`r q5c`**.

```{r ref.label='question-5', eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

```

Q6. Netflix provides over 200 weeks of service history for all but one country in our data set. Which country is this and when did Netflix cease operations in that country?

```{r question-6, include=FALSE}
# FIND COUNTRY WHERE NETFLIX CEASED OPERATIONS
q6a <-
COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
group_by(country_name)|>
summarise(week= n_distinct(week), max(week)) |>
filter(week < max(week)) |>
pull(country_name)

q6b <-
COUNTRY_TOP_10 |> 
group_by(country_name)|>
summarise(week= max(week)) |>
filter(week < max(week)) |>
pull(week) |>
format("%B %d, %Y")
```

Netflix ceased operations in **`r q6a`** on **`r q6b`**.

```{r ref.label='question-6', eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

```

Q7. What is the total viewership of the TV show Squid Game? Note that there are three seasons total and we are looking for the total number of hours watched across all seasons.

```{r question-7, include=FALSE}
# CALCULATE TOTAL VIEWERSHIP OF SQUID GAME
q7 <-
GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
filter(show_title=="Squid Game") |>
summarise(weekly_hours_viewed =sum(weekly_hours_viewed)) |>
pull(weekly_hours_viewed) |>
comma()
```

The total viewership of the TV show *Squid Game* across all seasons is **`r q7`** hours.

```{r ref.label='question-7', eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

```

Q8. The movie Red Notice has a runtime of 1 hour and 58 minutes. Approximately how many views did it receive in 2021?

```{r question-8, include=FALSE}
# CALCULATE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF VIEWS FOR RED NOTICE IN 2021
q8 <-
GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
filter(show_title=="Red Notice", year(week)==2021) |>
summarise(total_views = sum(weekly_hours_viewed/(118/60))) |>
pull(total_views) |>
comma()
```

*Red Notice* received approximately **`r q8`** views in 2021 based on the assumption that each viewer watched the entire movie.

```{r ref.label='question-8', eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

```

Q9. How many Films reached Number 1 in the US but did not originally debut there? That is, find films that first appeared on the Top 10 chart at, e.g., Number 4 but then became more popular and eventually hit Number 1? What is the most recent film to pull this off?

```{r question-9, include=FALSE}
# FIND NUMBER OF FILMS THAT REACHED NUMBER 1 IN US BUT DID NOT DEBUT THERE
q9a <-
COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
filter(country_name =="United States", category =="Films") |>
group_by(show_title) |>
summarise(
  first_week = min(week),
  first_rank = weekly_rank[week == min(week)][1],
  ever_number_1 = any(weekly_rank == 1),
  most_recent_week = max(week),
  .groups = "drop"
) |>
  filter(ever_number_1 == TRUE, first_rank != 1) |>
  nrow()

q9b  <-
COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
filter(country_name =="United States", category =="Films") |>
group_by(show_title) |>
summarise(
  first_week = min(week),
  first_rank = weekly_rank[week == min(week)][1],
  ever_number_1 = any(weekly_rank == 1),
  most_recent_week = max(week),
  .groups = "drop"
) |>
  filter(ever_number_1 == TRUE, first_rank != 1) |>
  arrange(desc(most_recent_week)) |>
  slice(1) |>
  pull(show_title)
  
```

The number of films that reached Number 1 in the US but did not originally debut there is **`r q9a`** with the most recent film to pull this off being ***`r q9b`***.

```{r ref.label='question-9', eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

```

Q10. Which TV show/season hit the top 10 in the most countries in its debut week? In how many countries did it chart?

```{r question-10, include=FALSE}
# FIND TV SHOW/SEASON THAT HIT TOP 10 IN MOST COUNTRIES IN DEBUT WEEK
q10a <-
COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
filter(category=="TV") |>
group_by(show_title) |>
filter(week==min(week)) |>

filter(week==min(week)) |>
summarise(num_countries = n_distinct(country_name)) |>
arrange(desc(num_countries)) |>
slice(1) |>
pull(num_countries)
```

The TV show/season that hit the top 10 in the most countries in its debut week is ***`r q10a`*** in **`r q10b`** countries.

```{r ref.label='question-10', eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
